---

## 1. UNIQUE FEATURES: What EchoCards Has That Anki Doesn't

### 1.1 Voice-First Interface
**Implementation**: Gemini Live API (2.5-flash-native-audio-preview-09-2025)
- **Real-time voice interaction**: Users can speak commands like "Start review for World Capitals" and the app responds with audio
- **Unified audio pipeline** (App.tsx, lines 25-33): Manages real-time conversational audio + TTS in synchronized queue
- **Voice selection**: 5 different voice personalities (Zephyr, Puck, Charon, Kore, Fenrir)
- **Input transcription**: Live voice-to-text for understanding user intent
- **No GUI interaction needed** during study sessions - everything is voice-controlled

### 1.2 Advanced AI Integration (Gemini 2.5)
**Implementation**: geminiService.ts (658 lines of AI capabilities)

#### Conversational Learning
- Interrupt reviews mid-card to ask "Why?", "Explain that", or "Tell me more"
- AI provides contextual explanations without breaking study flow
- Uses extended thinking for deeper analysis (`thinkingConfig: { thinkingBudget: 32768 }`)

#### AI Deck Generation
- **From Topics**: generateDeckFromForm() - Create decks on any subject with specified complexity levels (Beginner/Intermediate/Expert)
- **From Documents**: generateDeckFromDocument() - Upload text files and AI extracts key concepts into flashcards
- **Example**: Upload a Wikipedia article on photosynthesis, get structured Q&A cards automatically

#### Weakness-Based Learning (generateCardsFromWeakness)
- Analyzes your performance to find your weakest card (by lapses)
- Automatically generates 3 new related cards targeting that weakness
- Uses knowledge base for contextual card generation

#### Image Generation & Analysis
- **generateImage()**: Create visual aids from text descriptions (useful for visual learners)
- **analyzeImage()**: Upload images and ask AI questions about them
- Integration with Imagen 4.0 model

#### Multimodal Analysis
- **transcribeAudio()**: Convert audio recordings to text with Gemini
- **analyzeText()**: Analyze any text with simple or complex modes (uses extended thinking)

### 1.3 Advanced Spaced Repetition: FSRS Algorithm
**Implementation**: fsrs.ts (137 lines)

FSRS (Free Spaced Repetition Scheduler) is **scientifically superior** to Anki's SM-2:
- **Parameter optimization**: Uses 17-weight set optimized through ML research
- **Better accuracy**: FSRS predicts retention probability more accurately
- **Per-card difficulty**: Tracks individual difficulty (1-10 scale)
- **Stability modeling**: Represents how well you retain information
- **State machine**: Manages NEW → LEARNING → REVIEW → RELEARNING states
- **Lapse tracking**: Sophisticated handling of forgotten cards

**Code comparison**:
```typescript
// FSRS calculations (lines 108-124)
const stabilityAfterLapse = W[11] * Math.pow(card.difficulty, -W[12]) * 
  (Math.pow(card.stability + 1, W[13]) - 1) * 
  Math.exp((1 - retrievability) * W[14]);

// More factors adjusted based on rating:
const newDifficulty = card.difficulty - W[6] * (rating - 3);
const stabilityAfterGood = card.stability * 
  (1 + Math.exp(W[8]) * (11 - updatedCard.difficulty) * 
  Math.pow(card.stability, -W[9]) * ...);
```

### 1.4 Study Goal Tracking
- **Session goals**: "Review 20 cards in this session"
- **Daily goals**: "Review 30 cards per day" with persistent progress tracking
- Progress display on screen during study
- Automatic reset and notifications

### 1.5 Anki Deck Import
**Implementation**: ankiService.ts (363 lines)

- **Parse .apkg files**: ZIP archives with SQLite databases
- **Full conversion**: Notes → Cards, with template parsing
- **Scheduling migration**: Converts Anki's SM-2 scheduling to FSRS
- **Field extraction**: Intelligently maps Anki fields to Q&A format
- **HTML stripping**: Cleans formatting from Anki's rich HTML content
- **Lapse preservation**: Maintains learning history

## 2. MAJOR ANKI FEATURES THAT ECHOCARDS DOESN'T HAVE

### 2.1 Card Templates & Customization
**What Anki offers**:
- Create custom card types (Cloze, Basic, Multiple-choice, etc.)
- HTML/CSS customization for card appearance
- Custom front/back templates with conditional rendering
- Regex-based field processing

**EchoCards limitation**: Basic question/answer/explanation format only. No template system.

**Business impact**: Users cannot create specialized card types (cloze deletion, image occlusion, etc.)

### 2.2 Cloze Deletion
**Anki feature**: Hide parts of text with brackets `[...]` for fill-in-the-blank learning
```
"The capital of France is [Paris]."
"The chemical formula for water is [H2O]."
```

**EchoCards**: No native cloze support. Would require fundamental architecture change since voice interface doesn't naturally support fill-in-the-blank.

**Why important**: Cloze is proven effective for language learning and recall-based learning.

### 2.3 Comprehensive Statistics & Analytics Dashboard
**Anki provides**:
- Detailed learning graphs (ease factors over time, retention rates)
- Card success rates by interval
- Time spent studying
- Cards learned per day (streak tracking)
- Cumulative review load forecast

## 3. ARCHITECTURAL DIFFERENCES

### 3.1 Technology Stack

| Aspect | EchoCards | Anki |
|--------|-----------|------|
| **Language** | TypeScript + React 19 | Python (desktop) / JavaScript (web) |
| **Runtime** | Web browser + Vite | Desktop (Qt) + Mobile SDKs |
| **Database** | LocalStorage + IndexedDB | SQLite |
| **AI Integration** | Gemini 2.5 API (cloud) | None (local processing) |
| **Dependencies** | @google/genai, jszip, sql.js | PyYAML, Pillow, Requests |

### 3.2 Scheduling Algorithm: FSRS vs SM-2

#### SM-2 (Anki)
```
EF' = EF + (0.1 - (5 - grade) * (0.08 + (5 - grade) * 0.02))
I(1) = 1, I(2) = 3, I(n) = I(n-1) * EF
```
- **Simple math-based formula** from 1987
- Single "ease factor" per card
- Linear interval growth

#### FSRS (EchoCards)
```
stability = W[rating-1] (for new cards)
difficulty = W[4] - W[5] * (rating - 3)
// Complex multi-factor calculations for review cards (lines 108-135)
```
- **ML-optimized 17-parameter model**
- Separate stability + difficulty tracking
- Non-linear retention curve
- Validated against 60M+ real-world reviews
- Estimated 20-30% improvement over SM-2

### 3.3 Architecture Patterns

#### EchoCards: Voice-State-Machine Model
```typescript
// App.tsx: State-driven lifecycle
enum SessionState {
  IDLE, AWAITING_COMMAND, READING_QUESTION, 
  AWAITING_ANSWER_REVEAL, READING_ANSWER, AWAITING_RATING,
  CONVERSATION, EDITING_CARD, SHOWING_DECKS,
  IMPORTING_DECK, SHOWING_CARD_STATS, GENERATING_IMAGE,
  ANALYZING_IMAGE, TRANSCRIBING_AUDIO, SMART_GENERATION, etc.
}

// processAudioQueue: Queued audio playback (unified pipeline)
// handleLiveMessage: Real-time Gemini event processing
// processToolCall: Voice command execution
```

**Strengths**:
- Clear state flow
- Deterministic voice interaction
- Isolated concerns

**Weaknesses**:
- Complex state management
- No GUI fallback
- Limited to voice interpretation

#### Anki: Data-Centric Model
```python
# anki/collection.py: Database-first
# Cards loaded by SQL queries
# State inferred from due dates + queue fields
# Scheduler calculates next interval on-demand
```

**Strengths**:
- Flexible querying
- Extensible data model
- Multi-interface compatible

**Weaknesses**:
- Large Python runtime
- Complex data schema

### 3.4 AI Model Integration

#### EchoCards: Live API (Real-time)
```typescript
ai.live.connect({
  model: 'gemini-2.5-flash-native-audio-preview-09-2025',
  callbacks: {
    onmessage: handleLiveMessage,  // Real-time streaming
  },
  config: {
    responseModalities: [Modality.AUDIO],
    tools: [{ functionDeclarations: controlFunctions }]
  }
})
```

**Capabilities**:
- Streaming responses
- Function calling (24 tools)
- Real-time conversational flow
- Audio I/O in single connection

**Cost**: API calls (estimated $0.001-0.01 per review session depending on conversation)

#### Anki: No AI (Local)
- All processing on user's device
- No API dependencies
- No recurring costs
- Completely offline capable

### 3.5 Data Persistence

| Aspect | EchoCards | Anki |
|--------|-----------|------|
| **Default Storage** | Browser LocalStorage | SQLite file |
| **Sync** | None | AnkiWeb (optional) |
| **Backup** | Manual export | Automatic snapshots |
| **Privacy** | Gemini API sees queries | Completely local |
| **Cloud** | API calls logged by Google | Optional AnkiWeb sync |

### 3.6 Session Management

**EchoCards** (App.tsx lines 855-873):
```typescript
startSession = async () => {
  const session = await geminiService.connectLive(
    handleLiveMessage,      // Streaming message handler
    onError,               // Error callback
    onClose,               // Connection close callback
    selectedVoice,         // Voice preference
    isConversationalModeEnabled  // Feature flag
  );
  sessionRef.current = session;
}
```

**Key behaviors**:
- Single long-lived WebSocket connection
- Bi-directional audio streaming
- Tool call processing with immediate responses
- Session ends when socket closes

**Anki**:
- Stateless HTTP calls (fetch deck, submit review)
- No persistent connection
- Multiple independent transactions

## 9. IMPLEMENTATION INSIGHTS

### 9.1 How EchoCards Implements Voice Control

**Key flow** (App.tsx + geminiService.ts):

```
1. startSession()
   ↓
2. connectLive() establishes WebSocket to Gemini
   ├─ AudioContext with INPUT_AUDIO_SAMPLE_RATE (16kHz)
   ├─ getUserMedia() for microphone
   └─ ScriptProcessor captures audio chunks
   
3. handleLiveMessage() processes server responses
   ├─ inputTranscription: User's voice-to-text
   ├─ toolCall: Function call (startReview, rateCard, etc.)
   └─ modelTurn.parts[0].inlineData.data: Audio response
   
4. Tool responses sent to Gemini via sendToolResponse()
   ↓
5. Gemini generates audio response
   ↓
6. decodeAudioData() converts base64 → AudioBuffer
   ↓
7. audioQueue manages playback order
   ↓
8. AudioBufferSourceNode.start() plays to speakers
```

### 9.2 Why FSRS Is Better

**SM-2 Problem**: Single ease factor doesn't capture:
- How well you know the card
- How difficult the card is
- Non-linear retention curves
- Individual variation

**FSRS Solution**:
- Separate `stability` (how well you know it) and `difficulty` (how hard it is)
- 17-parameter model trained on 60M reviews
- Predicts 90% retention (adjustable)
- Exponential decay curve matches neuroscience

**Mathematical advantage**:
SM-2: Interval grows linearly with ease factor
FSRS: Interval grows based on desired retention % and stability
