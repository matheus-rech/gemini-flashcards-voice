## 3. Conversational Agent Behavior - Point-by-Point Reading ‚úÖ

### How the Voice Assistant Works:

**YES**, the agent reads everything point-by-point in a structured workflow:

#### Step-by-Step Review Flow:

1. **Session Start**
   - Say: "Start session"
   - Agent: "Hello! I'm Echo, your flashcard assistant. Say 'Start review for [deck name]' to begin."

2. **Begin Review**
   - Say: "Start review of World Capitals"
   - Agent: *Reads the question aloud*
   - Status: "Say 'Show Answer' when ready."

3. **Reveal Answer**
   - Say: "Show answer"
   - Agent: *Reads the answer aloud, then says* "How did you do? Say Again, Hard, Good, or Easy."

4. **Rate Your Performance**
   - Say: "Good" (or Again/Hard/Easy)
   - Agent: *Moves to next card and repeats from step 2*

5. **Review Complete**
   - Agent: "Review complete! Well done."

### Conversational Learning Mode üí°

**When enabled**, you can **interrupt** at any time to ask questions:

**During a review:**
- Say: "Why?" or "Explain this" or "Tell me more"
- Agent: *Provides detailed explanation*
- Then automatically returns to the review

**Example Flow with Interruption:**
```
Agent: "What is the capital of France?"
You: "Show answer"
Agent: "Paris. How did you do?"
You: "Wait, why is Paris the capital?"
Agent: "Paris became the capital of France in 987 AD when Hugh Capet..."
Agent: "Okay, let's continue. How did you do on the card?"
You: "Good"
Agent: *moves to next card*
